This is a Go wrapper that provides access to the [Transport for London (TfL) Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). It allows developers to retrieve information about TfL services, such as tube lines, bus routes, and bike points.

## Installation

To install the TfL Go Library, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/jamesalexatkin/tfl-golang
```

## Authentication

You'll need to [register](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/) for an API key from TfL in order to use this API.

## Example usage

TODO

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

If making a pull request, please ensure that the linter checks pass (by running `make lint`) and that tests still work. You'll need to grab an API key to run integration tests locally. Set the two environment variables (`APP_ID` and `APP_KEY`) accordingly, then run `make test-all` to run unit and integration tests.

## License
